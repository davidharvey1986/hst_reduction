ALIGNING_IMAGES.TXT
--------------------

	This is the most important part of the code as 
	aligning images that are mosaiced, rotated or offset
	in some way, if done incorrectly will result in crazy images

	This is mostly automated, however will often require some
	tweaking from the user in the case of very offset images.
	If the overlap between images is very small this can often
	struggle.
	
	I strongly suggest the user reads
	The attached Aligning_for_ACS.pdf
